I started this site to keep track of all computer related topics I'm
working on day after day.

This will be a bunch of posts, articles, notes, drafts (all it
whatever you want) on readings, talk, practices, experiences.

Doing it will help to :
- keep track of what I am working
- improve my skills on explaining/presenting technical information
- clarify my mind on the topic
- prepare for presentation
- sharing

More to come next !
